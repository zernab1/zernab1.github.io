I have an interview tomorrow and I'm spiraling a little on Leetcode. I swear I've programmed before (being a SWE for 5+ years, that's hard to avoid).

But there's just something about Leetcode that feels like a completely different breed than on the job coding. I feel like such a fraud looking any sort of syntax-related solutions up, or sometimes the guilt hits hard when I finally give up and delve into the googling the solution halfway into figuring it out. I mean, that's what I do while programming at work! Google is my friend...

No google make brain go wobbley. LOL, like it's without the crutches it direly needs.

Anyway! Doing a couple of labeled 'easy' problems on Leetcode tonight. I found myself trying to grab for some sort of way to reverse strings a lot. 

The palindrome problem was one of the first whiteboard problems I got absolutely creamed on in an interview earlier in my career. And back then, in the aftermath of the embarassment I had felt, I obsessively taught myself to memorize the solution. The next time it somehow miraculously came up in another interview, I knew what to do! 

Haha, I remember I basically implemented a reverse method in java. It had to do with writing the for-loop to index starting at the end of the string and decrement from there, instead of incrementing. Something like:
`for(int i = str.length-1; i > 0; i--)`
And then from there inside that for loop was basically just a simple conditional check (if-statement), to see if the value of the index we were at wasn't equal to the other end of the string. If it wasn't we'd return false.

But now I'm doing this in Python, and honestly it's been years since I last did this problem in Java I'm not even sure if I'd remember the java syntax without looking it up.

And this guys, *this* is why I love Python: The solution I got for this problem is a single lined return statement! :') Isn't that sexy? 

There's this fun little trick to reverse strings in Python:
`[::-1]`

I'll break it down for explaination-

The `[:]` is the syntax Python uses for slicing, which is just a way to get pieces you need from a list/string/tuple...it's a way to specify a new sequence by giving it a range on indices you want. The syntax looks like this:

`str[start:stop:step]`

*start* is the (inclusive) index that you will be starting at from the string. 

*stop* is the (exclusive, meaning if you specify you're stopping at index x, then the last element in the new string will be x-1) index that you end on.

*step* is step size between elements in the slice. This is where the reverse magic happens!!

If you give a negative step size, it reverses the sequence and takes the step size of whatever  was defined.
