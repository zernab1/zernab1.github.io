title: A MEDIUM Leetcode ProblemðŸ˜±
---

Alright, I've graduated myself to a "Medium" marked Leetcode problem. Lets break down this problem:

---

## Gas Station
* There's this circular path (think *Greedy* algorithm, you need to do better with recognizing what greedy problems look like)
* This paths got an `n` number of gas stations
* Input includes: 
    * `gas` array, where `gas[i]` gives you the amount of gas at the `ith` gas station
    * `cost` array, where `cost[i]` gives you the cost of gas to travel from the `ith` station to next `(i + 1)th` station
* You are starting in a car *with an empty tank* (initialize to 0) at one of the `i` gas stations
* The goal? **Return which gas station to start at if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1**

Here's an example:
*Input:* `gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `cost= [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
*Output:* `3`
