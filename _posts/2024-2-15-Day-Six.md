title: A MEDIUM Leetcode ProblemðŸ˜±
---

I know I have to try at least a couple medium problems. Lets break down this problem:

---

## Gas Station
* `n` gas stations on a circular route
* `gas[i]` gives you the amount of gas at `ith` station
* `cost[i]` gives you ccost to move from `ith` to `(i+1)th` station
* When you start, the car has *an empty tank* (initialize to 0)
* The goal? **Return which gas station to start at if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1**

Here's an example:
*Input:* `gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `cost= [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
*Output:* `3`

I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPsQVD4rthY) solution online eventually:

```python
totalGas = 0
currGas = 0
station = 0

for i in range(len(gas)):
    totalGas += gas[i] - cost[i]
    currGas += gas[i] - cost[i]

    if currGas < 0:
        currGas = 0
        station = i + 1

return station if totalGas >= 0 else -1
```

and at first I couldn't make sense of it, but dry running the example in a table helped me immensely:
| Iteration # | i  | gas[i] | cost[i] | currGas | totalGas | start |
|-------------|----|--------|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| 1           | 0  | 1      | 3       | -2 *(actually 0 by the end of the if statement in the iteration)      | -2       | 1     |
| 2           | 1  | 2      | 4       | -2 *(0)     | -4       | 2     |
| 3           | 2  | 3      | 5       | -2 *(0)     | -6       | 3     |
| 4           | 3  | 4      | 1       | 3       | -3       | 3     |
| 5           | 4  | 5      | 2       | 6       | 0        | 3     |


This guys solution made the great case that you must focus on the net gas balance (total gas minus total cost). That's really all you need to know whether you can complete the circut or not! This net gas balance remains consistent, no matter where in the circuit you start.

- **Gas**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- **Cost**: `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

**Total Gas**:  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

**Total Cost**:  
3 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 15

**Net Balance**:  
15 - 15 = 0

So concluding remarks, if totalGas is less than totalCost, it is impossible to complete the circuit from any starting point. However, if totalGas is greater than or equal to totalCost, you can always find a valid starting point.
