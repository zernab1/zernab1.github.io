title: Leetcode and Roman Numerals
---

Doing some More Leetcode today! I want to try at least 1 more Easy ones before graduating onto a Medium:

For this problem, it's essential to understand how Roman numerals are represented. Here's a table, (it was a good sign that the first thing that popped into my head when I saw this table is the need for a **map** data structure):
| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Getting straight to some examples is probably the best way to explain this problem:

### Example 1:
Input: `s = "III"`
Output: `3`
Breakdown: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Example 2:
Input: `s = "XII"`
Output: `12`
Breakdown: 10 + 1 + 1 = 12

### Example 3:
Input: `s = "IV"`
Output: `4`
Breakdown: 5 - 1 = 4 (because a smaller numeral `I` comes before the `V`, we subtract)

### Example 4:
Input: `s = "MCMXCIV"`
Output: `1994`
Breakdown: 100 + (1000 - 100) + (100 - 10) + (5 - 1) = 1994

There's a couple of points we can conjure up to help us get started by going through these examples:
* We're definitely going to need a check to see if the current numeral is greater than or less than the previous one when traversing through the string
    * This would be to determine whether we are adding (current numeral is >) or subtracting (current numeral is <)

For example, in `LVIII`, L=50 which is > V=5 which is > III=3, and so we simply add all of them. If we had `XL`, however, that wouldn't be 10 + 50=60. Because X < L (10 < 50), we would subtract 50 - 10 and get 40.

* Notice when determining if we're subtracting, we compare the numeral to the *right* of the current one. This comparisons going to be hard if we're traversing (with a single pointer) through the string from left to right, as we wouldn't have seen the numeral to the right of our current one.
    * Maybe **reverse** the roman numeral string to fix this issue?

I first created a dictionary for the roman numeral to number mappings:
```
 roman_dict = {
    'I': 1,
    'V': 5,
    'X': 10,
    'L': 50,
    'C': 100,
    'D': 500,
    'M': 1000
    }
```

Next, create result variable to save the converted number to return, and a for-loop that iterates through the string reversed: 

```
    result = 0
    prev_value = 0

    for char in reversed(s):
        if roman_dict[char] < prev_value:
            result -= roman_dict[char]
        else:
            result += roman_dict[char]

        prev_value = roman_dict[char]

    return result
```

Here's a dry run of looping through for the input `MCMXCIV` (remember we're looping through the string reversed):

| Iteration | char | roman_dict[char]      | prev_value           | result |
|---------------|------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1             | V    | 5                 | 0  (initialized val) | 5      |
| 2             | I    | 1                 | 5                    | 4      |
| 3             | C    | 100               | 1                    | 104    |
| 4             | X    | 10                | 100                  | 94     |
| 5             | M    | 1000              | 10                   | 1094   |
| 6             | C    | 100               | 1000                 | 994    |
| 7             | M    | 1000              | 100                  | 1994   |
