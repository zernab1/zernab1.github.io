title: Day 0 of trying '\#100DaysofCode?'
---

So. I'm starting this blog as a way to hold myself accountable with regards to learning new topics for my career growth. As a current Software Engineer aspiring to break into the world of **data**, I feel the industry disconnect when it comes to interviewing for Data/ML Engineering roles, despite my Masters degree in Machine Learning at UMD.

I want to change that by refreshing my skillset and use this blog to document my learning process, share resources that have assisted me in my growth, and discuss hurdles I encounter along the way. 

I also want to use this as an excuse to experiment and figure out which side of working with data I enjoy more. 

Whether that's more on the side of data infrastructure and creating those ETL pipelines (data engineer), or analyzing, transforming and deriving insight from data (data scientist). 

Cool how data engineers feel kinda DevOps-y to me, I could see that being interesting work too, (and I also know I could very easily have an interesting Web Dev project fall into my lap and be happy and driven about that as well). However, I really want a reason to use my ML degree, and to finally solidify learning what I'm less familiar with, (and use the degree my employer dropped 30 grand on!)

Initially, I was going to use Twitter to start the "100 days of code" challenge, but I thought setting up a blog using Github Pages might be a cooler way of going about documenting this learning process. Besides, I've been wanting to set up a static website for blogging purposes for a while anyway.

This first post isn't really reporting on substantial coding I've done as of yet, the setup for Github pages is pretty straightforward:
    + Create a repo named yourusername.github.io
    + Clone the repo locally
    + Add the static content to it
    + Add/Commit/Push your changes to git

I guess I've taken a little while today trying to figure out how to customize this static blog (looking through Jekyll themes and messing with some css styling later maybe) but, yeah. All that can wait, haha. 

My immediate need for this blog is documenting my ML-related learning process and using tools that keep coming up in job descriptions for Data Engineers/Data Scientist/ML Engineers roles and actually _use_ them. 

Because there's nothing that makes you feel more like a fraud than applying to jobs where you don't have experience with, like, half the tools they have listed in the description of the role. Namely some (off the top of my head): 
    + Apache Sparks/its predecessor MapReduce in Hadoop?
    + dbt
    + Tableau/PowerBI
    + In desperate need of a Tensorflow/Keras refresher

I have always found [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) helpful with the dev community and resources they have, and starting their ML with Python curiculum introduced me to Tim Ruscica today, a SW Dev who has these neat tutorials for Tensorflow I wanna look into. 

I think I'll start there and report my findings tomorrow for Day 1 in the next post. 

Okay! Here goes...Day 0!!!
