ðŸ‘‹ Hello World, I'm Zernab.

## Background

I have been a SWE for 6+ years now, I received my Master's degree in Machine Learning from UMD in the Spring of 2023. 

Since then, I have been lacking a routine way to keep my hands dirty with ML experience. I am hoping that this blog will be a solution to that! From Leetcode problem workthroughs to bigger ML or even Web Dev personal project, I plan to use this blog to document my daily review and deepen my expertise in the field to help better prep me for interviews.

Read more about the origin story of this blog in my [Day 0](_posts/2024-2-7-Day-Zero.md) post.

## Mission

Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and refresh my own memory of ML concepts learned in grad school as I navigate what expertise industry requires of ML Engineer/Data Scientist roles I am currently applying to.
