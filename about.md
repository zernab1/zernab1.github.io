ðŸ‘‹ Hello World, I'm Zernab.

## Background

I have been a SWE for 6+ years now, I received my Master's degree in Machine Learning from UMD in the Spring of 2023. 

Since then, due to my current job I have been lacking a routine way to keep my hands dirty with ML experience and newer Web Dev technologies. I am hoping this blog will be a solution to that! From Leetcode problem workthroughs to bigger ML or even Web Dev personal project, I plan to use this blog to document my daily review and deepen my expertise in the field to help better prep me for job interviews.

Read more about the origin story of this blog in my [Day 0](_posts/2024-2-7-Day-Zero.md) post.

## Mission

This blog will act as a sort of monologue, a yell into the void of newly learned topics and ongoing projects. Perhaps someday this can be organized enough to be useful to others, but for now this serves my purposes.
